## 🚀 How to Add Assets

### Option 1: Export from Your Designs
You showed me beautiful mockups with:
- Home screen logo
- Character designs
- Token designs
- Wallet icons

Simply export those images and place them in the folders above!

### Option 2: Use Placeholders Temporarily
The app works with built-in placeholder icons. You can:
1. Run the app now with placeholders
2. Add real images later
3. Hot reload to see them instantly (no rebuild needed)

### Option 3: Generate with AI
Use tools like:
- Midjourney
- DALL-E
- Stable Diffusion

**Prompt example:**
```
"pirate character avatar, vintage style, circular frame with
ornate gold border, dark teal background, 17th century Spanish
colonial theme, high detail"
```

---

## 📝 After Adding Images

1. Place images in the correct folders
2. Make sure filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Run:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

Or if app is already running, just press 'r' to hot reload!

## ⚡ Quick Start

**Minimum to run the app:**
- None! The app works with placeholders

**For full visual experience:**

Everything else is optional and can be added later.
