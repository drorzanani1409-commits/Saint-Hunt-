# 🚀 GitHub Setup - Step by Step

## ✅ What I've Already Done For You:
- ✅ Initialized Git in your project
- ✅ Added all your files
- ✅ Created initial commit
- ✅ Opened GitHub for you

---

## 📋 What YOU Need To Do Now:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Account (if you don't have one)

**If you DON'T have a GitHub account:**
1. Close the "New Repository" page
2. Go to: https://github.com/signup
3. Enter your email
4. Create password
5. Choose username (like "drorz" or whatever you want)
6. Verify email
7. Come back here!

**If you ALREADY have a GitHub account:**
- Just sign in to the page I opened
- Continue to Step 2

---

### Step 2: Create New Repository on GitHub

On the "Create a new repository" page that I opened:

1. **Repository name:** `saint-hunt`
   (Type exactly: saint-hunt)

2. **Description:** 
   ```
   GPS Scavenger Hunt App for St. Augustine, Florida
   ```

3. **Public or Private:** Choose **Private** (recommended for now)

4. **DO NOT check these boxes:**
   - ❌ Do NOT add README
   - ❌ Do NOT add .gitignore
   - ❌ Do NOT choose a license
   
   (We already have these files!)

5. **Click the green "Create repository" button**

---

### Step 3: Copy the Repository URL

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you a page with commands.

**Look for a section that says:**
```
…or push an existing repository from the command line
```

**You'll see something like:**
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/saint-hunt.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Copy YOUR repository URL** (looks like):
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/saint-hunt.git
```

---

### Step 4: Tell Me Your Repository URL

**Come back to this chat and paste:**
- Your GitHub repository URL

**Example:**
```
https://github.com/drorz/saint-hunt.git
```

**I will then push your code to GitHub automatically!**

---

## 🆘 Don't Have GitHub Account?

**Option A: Create GitHub account (5 minutes)**
- Go to: https://github.com/signup
- Free forever
- Best option for Codemagic

**Option B: Use GitHub Desktop (Easier)**
- Download: https://desktop.github.com/
- Signs you up AND uploads code
- More visual, easier for beginners

---

## ❓ What Happens Next?

Once your code is on GitHub:
1. ✅ I'll connect it to Codemagic
2. ✅ Codemagic will build iOS app (no Mac needed!)
3. ✅ Codemagic will build Android app
4. ✅ You download both apps and test!

## 📞 Ready?

**After creating your GitHub repository, tell me:**

"Here's my repo: [paste URL]"

**Or if you need help:**

- "I don't have GitHub account" - I'll guide you
- "I prefer GitHub Desktop" - I'll show you easier way
- "Can you do it differently?" - I'll find another way

## 🎉 You're Almost There!

Your app is ready to build! Just need to get it on GitHub first! 🚀
